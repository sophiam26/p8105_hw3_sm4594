## Loading Instacart data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

## Description of Instacart Dataset

The dataset used here is a cleaned and limited subset of the original
Instacart data. Each row in this dataset represents a single product
from an Instacart order. There are 1384617 rows and 15 columns in the
dataset. Each observation has an order identifier (`order_id`), product
identifier (`product_id`), and customer identifier (`user_id`). Key
variables include `reordered`, which indicates if the product has been
ordered by the customer in the past month, `order_dow`, which indicates
which day of the week the order was placed, `days_since_prior_order`,
which indicates the number of days since the customer’s last order, and
`product_name`, which is the name of the product ordered. For example,
the mean number of days between orders is 17.0661259.

## Exploratory data analysis of Instacart data

``` r
instacart %>% 
 summarize(
   n_aisles = n_distinct(aisle_id))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   n_aisles
    ##      <int>
    ## 1      134

``` r
## change this to inline r code?
```

There are 134 aisles in the Instacart dataset.

``` r
names(which.max(table(pull(instacart, aisle))))
```

    ## [1] "fresh vegetables"

``` r
## return top three aisles rather than top one
```

The most items are ordered from the Fresh Vegetables aisle.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_items_ordered = n()
  ) %>% 
   
  filter(n_items_ordered > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_items_ordered, y = aisle )) + geom_point()
```
