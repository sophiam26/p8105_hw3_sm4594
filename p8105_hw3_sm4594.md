## Description of Instacart Dataset

The dataset used here is a cleaned and limited subset of the original
Instacart data. Each row in this dataset represents a single product
from an Instacart order. There are 1384617 rows and 15 columns in the
dataset. Each observation has an order identifier (`order_id`), product
identifier (`product_id`), and customer identifier (`user_id`). Key
variables include `reordered`, which indicates if the product has been
ordered by the customer in the past month, `order_dow`, which indicates
which day of the week the order was placed, `days_since_prior_order`,
which indicates the number of days since the customerâ€™s last order, and
`product_name`, which is the name of the product ordered. For example,
the mean number of days between orders is 17.0661259.
